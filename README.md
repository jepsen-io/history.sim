[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/io.jepsen/history.sim.svg)](https://clojars.org/io.jepsen/history.sim)

When building a database checker, you need histories to check. These histories
should exhibit certain classes of anomalies, so that you can test whether the
checker is correct. They should be determistic, so you can build regression
tests. They should be large enough to serve as performance benchmarks. This
library generates those histories by simulating concurrent requests against
models of databases with assorted concurrency control schemes.

As a Clojure library, jepsen.history.sim provides histories to JVM programs
which ask for them. These histories are cached in your local tmpdir, so they're
fast on repeated access. Histories are read lazily from chunks, wrapped in a
jepsen.history.IHistory, so they work with parallel folds out of the box.

As an executable jar, this program can emit histories in EDN or JSON to stdout.
You can use this to benchmark checkers written in other languages.

## Library use

The main entry point for the library is `jepsen.history.sim`. Here's how to get a quick history from a snapshot isolated database:

```clj
=> (require '[jepsen.history.sim :as sim])
=> (pprint (sim/run {}))
{:concurrency 3,
 :limit 16,
 :db :si,
 :generator :list-append,
 :history
  [{:process 0,
   :type :invoke,
   :f :txn,
   :value [[:append 9 1] [:r 9 nil]],
   :index 0,
   :time -1}
  {:process 1,
   :type :invoke,
   :f :txn,
   :value [[:append 9 2]],
   :index 1,
   :time -1}
```

`run` takes and returns a test map. This map includes several parameters: the
db, the generator, concurrency, and so on. `run` fills in defaults if you don't
provide any. Once run, a test has a `:history` field with a Jepsen history of
operations.

Key distribution, transaction size, etc are all configurable; see
`jepsen.history.sim/run`'s docs. Let's say we wanted a prefix-consistent
history of 2 processes running 3 operations:

```clj
=> (->> (sim/run {:db :prefix, :concurrency 2, :limit 3}) :history (mapv prn))
{:index 0, :time -1, :type :invoke, :process 1, :f :txn, :value [[:append 9 1] [:r 9 nil]]}
{:index 1, :time -1, :type :invoke, :process 0, :f :txn, :value [[:append 9 2]]}
{:index 2, :time -1, :type :ok, :process 0, :f :txn, :value [[:append 9 2]]}
{:index 3, :time -1, :type :invoke, :process 0, :f :txn, :value [[:r 8 nil] [:r 9 nil]]}
{:index 4, :time -1, :type :ok, :process 0, :f :txn, :value [[:r 8 nil] [:r 9 [2]]]}
{:index 5, :time -1, :type :ok, :process 1, :f :txn, :value [[:append 9 1] [:r 9 [2 1]]]}
```

Runs are fully deterministic. Ask for the same parameters again and you'll get
an identical history. If you want a different random seed, you can ask for it:

```clj
=> (sim/run {:seed 3 :limit 1})
{:concurrency 3, :limit 1, :db :si, :generator :list-append, :seed 3, :history [{:index 0, :time -1, :type :invoke, :process 0, :f :txn, :value [[:r 9 nil]]} {:index 1, :time -1, :type :ok, :process 0, :f :txn, :value [[:r 9 nil]]}]}

=> (sim/run {:seed 4 :limit 1})
{:concurrency 3, :limit 1, :db :si, :generator :list-append, :seed 4, :history [{:index 0, :time -1, :type :invoke, :process 1, :f :txn, :value [[:append 9 1] [:r 4 nil]]} {:index 1, :time -1, :type :ok, :process 1, :f :txn, :value [[:append 9 1] [:r 4 nil]]}]}
```

Runs are cached to disk transparently, making subsequent requests for identical
parameters much, much faster. You can erase this cache with
`(jepsen.history.cache/clear!)`.

## CLI Use

To build a fat jar, first install a JDK, install leiningen, and run `lein
uberjar`. This will emit a jar in `target/history.sim-...-standalone.jar` with
an executable binary. Then try

```
java -jar target/history.sim-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar history
```

This emits a short history of sixteen operations (16 invokes, 16 completions)
like so. These are list-append operations from a simulated snapshot isolated
database, and can be fed directly to Elle's list-append checker.

```clj
{:index 0, :time -1, :type :invoke, :process 0, :f :txn, :value [[:append 9 1] [:r 9 nil]]}
{:index 1, :time -1, :type :invoke, :process 1, :f :txn, :value [[:append 9 2]]}
{:index 2, :time -1, :type :invoke, :process 2, :f :txn, :value [[:r 8 nil] [:r 9 nil]]}
{:index 3, :time -1, :type :ok, :process 0, :f :txn, :value [[:append 9 1] [:r 9 [1]]]}
{:index 4, :time -1, :type :invoke, :process 0, :f :txn, :value [[:r 7 nil]]}
{:index 5, :time -1, :type :fail, :process 1, :f :txn, :value [[:append 9 2]]}
...
```

You can tune the number of operations with `--limit`, the concurrency with
`--concurrency`, the database with `--db`, and the output format with
`--format`. Here's a million operations by ten concurrent clients on a
serializable-snapshot-isolated database, printed as lines of JSON.

```
java -jar target/history.sim-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar history --limit 1000000 --concurrency 10 --db prefix --format json
```

```json
{"index":0,"time":-1,"type":"invoke","process":7,"f":"txn","value":[["append",9,1],["r",9,null]]}
{"index":1,"time":-1,"type":"invoke","process":2,"f":"txn","value":[["append",9,2]]}
{"index":2,"time":-1,"type":"invoke","process":5,"f":"txn","value":[["r",8,null],["r",9,null]]}
{"index":3,"time":-1,"type":"invoke","process":4,"f":"txn","value":[["r",7,null]]}
{"index":4,"time":-1,"type":"invoke","process":6,"f":"txn","value":[["r",9,null],["r",9,null]]}
{"index":5,"time":-1,"type":"invoke","process":0,"f":"txn","value":[["r",9,null]]}
{"index":6,"time":-1,"type":"invoke","process":1,"f":"txn","value":[["append",6,1]]}
{"index":7,"time":-1,"type":"invoke","process":3,"f":"txn","value":[["append",8,1],["r",7,null]]}
{"index":8,"time":-1,"type":"invoke","process":8,"f":"txn","value":[["r",9,null],["r",6,null]]}
{"index":9,"time":-1,"type":"invoke","process":9,"f":"txn","value":[["append",8,2],["append",8,3]]}
```

This takes a while the first time, but run the command again and it'll start
printing immediately: the simulator will re-use its cached copy of the history
on disk. Takes about 35 seconds to finish printing all million ops on my aging
Xeon.

For full usage, run jepsen.history.sim without any arguments.

```

## DBs

Databases live in `jepsen.history.sim.db`. There are presently four
implementations:

- `brat`, which has no concurrency control whatsoever
- `prefix`, which is "snapshot isolation, without the first-committer-wins checkl"
- `si`, which is a by-the-book implementation of single-node snapshot isolation
- `ssi`, which makes SI serializable by promoting all writes to reads
